= The different ways of creating fakes =

One of the main motivation for creating FakeItEasy is to provide a framework that can be used in the way the developer wants to use it. Some developers likesthe "Moq"-way, that is creating an object that provides an interface for configuring and asserting on a fake object, along with a property for the faked object itself. Others like the "Rhino"-way where proxies of the faked type are created directly. Using fake it easy two different developers on the same project can use the same framework in those different ways.


= Details =
== Proxies ==
To create a faked instance of a given type you simply write:

*C#*
{{{
var foo = A.Fake<IFoo>();
}}}

*VB*
{{{
Dim foo = A.Fake(Of IFoo)()
}}}
== Fake objects ==
To create the Moq-style fake objects:

*C#*
{{{
var fake = new Fake<IFoo>();
}}}

*VB*
{{{
Dim fake As New Fake(Of IFoo)()
}}}
